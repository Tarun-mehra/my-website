            <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8 fade-in">
                So here's the thing about working IT at a luxury hotel – you'd think the biggest challenges would be fancy tech problems, right? Nope. It was Wi-Fi. Always the Wi-Fi.
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                During my internship last summer, I probably handled Wi-Fi complaints at least 5-6 times daily. Guests would come down to the front desk, visibly frustrated because they couldn't connect for their business calls or Netflix binges. The pressure was real because when someone's paying premium rates for a room, they expect everything to work perfectly.
            </p>

            <h2>The Access Point Overload Problem</h2>
            
            <p class="fade-in">
                I remember this one weekend when the hotel was fully booked for a wedding. Suddenly, the entire west wing started complaining about slow internet. Turns out, everyone was connected to just two access points while four others sat there practically idle.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box fade-in">
                <p class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Key Lesson:</p>
                <p>Once I figured out how to log into the controller (took me a few tries initially, not gonna lie), I could see the distribution was completely lopsided. After balancing the load, guests stopped calling within the hour.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="fade-in">
                This experience taught me that network management isn't just about having enough access points—it's about intelligent load distribution. In high-density environments like hotels, users naturally gravitate toward the strongest signal, often creating imbalanced loads that degrade performance for everyone.
            </p>

            <h2>When Guests Become Accidental Hackers</h2>
            
            <p class="fade-in">
                Here's something I never expected – some business travelers would bring their own portable routers to create personal hotspots. Sounds harmless, but these things wreaked havoc on our network. They'd create interference and confuse other devices.
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                My supervisor showed me how to identify these rogue devices in the system, and we'd politely ask guests to disconnect them. Most people had no idea they were causing issues. This taught me about the importance of network monitoring and the human side of IT support.
            </p>

            <h2>The Mystery of the 169 Addresses</h2>
            
            <p class="fade-in">
                Ever see an IP address starting with 169.254? Yeah, that became my nemesis for a while. Devices were assigning themselves these weird APIPA addresses because they couldn't reach our DHCP server.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box fade-in">
                <p class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Technical Insight:</p>
                <p>APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) addresses are self-assigned when DHCP servers are unreachable. The first few times this happened, I panicked. But eventually I learned that restarting the DHCP service usually cleared things up. Sometimes the simple solutions are the best ones.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="fade-in">
                The pattern became predictable: during peak check-in times, the DHCP server would get overwhelmed with requests, causing timeouts and APIPA assignments. We implemented DHCP relay agents and increased lease times to handle the load better.
            </p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            
            <p class="fade-in">
                Looking back, those two months taught me more about practical networking than an entire semester of classes. Theory is great, but nothing beats troubleshooting real problems with impatient guests waiting for answers.
            </p>

            <ul class="fade-in">
                <li><strong>Load balancing is crucial</strong> in high-density environments</li>
                <li><strong>Human factors</strong> often cause more network issues than technical failures</li>
                <li><strong>Simple solutions</strong> are often the most effective</li>
                <li><strong>Communication skills</strong> are as important as technical knowledge</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and logging</strong> are essential for proactive problem-solving</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="fade-in">
                The experience also taught me about the business impact of technical issues. When guests can't connect, it affects reviews, repeat business, and ultimately revenue. This business perspective has influenced how I approach every technical decision since.
